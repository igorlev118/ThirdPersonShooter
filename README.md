# ThirdPersonShooter

This is a project that I created next to my job. It is Shooter type game demo, with a single level you can play through.

The project is not finished yet. In study of development. Downloaded only source code for the time being. Source code is a bit rusty and not structured so please do not pay much attention to it.
